THINGS I AM APOLOGIZING FOR:

-beer has 'id' and 'randID'. Because I'm using 'randID' as primary key, calling Beer.id DOES NOT return the numerical ID; it returns the 'randID' string. To get the numerical ID, you have to call Beer['id']. I am truly sorry.





Rails Notes:
  -inside a controller action, redirect_to isn't enough to keep code after that from executing. You have to 'return redirect_to ...'

  -for a database reset FROM THE MIGRATIONS, do `rake db:drop db:create db:migrate db:seed`
  -for a database reset FROM CURRENT SCHEMA, do `rake db:reset`


  GRRRRR ActiveRecord downcases column names:
  Beer.order("receivedAT DESC") returns:
  'ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid: PG::UndefinedColumn: ERROR:  column "receivedat" does not exist'






More Notes:

current_user is one of these:
